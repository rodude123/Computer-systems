#Operating Systems 

##What Is An Operating System:

*An operating system is a program that:

   1. Offers a user interface to start programs on the machine
 
   2. Manages a computers andf allows the programmer to make use of resources such as the CPU,
      memory, file storage, input output and network connections
 
   3. Supports systems calls
       - A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.A system call is made when 
         a request is sent to the operating systems kernel. 
       - A Kernel is the first section of the operating system to load into the memory. 
 
   4. Offers protection against threats to such as malware viruses, remote hacker intrusions etc.
       - It protects itself using methods such as regular patch updates, installing antiviruses,
         and checking incoming and outgoing traffic through a firewall. 
      
*Common types of Operating Systems include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Ubuntu Linux and macOS.

##The Kernel 

*The kernel is a one of the major subsystems in a operating system which is controlled by the user. 

*It is controlled via the shell.

*The kernel acts as the central service for all the parts of the computer and is in charge of all the 
 computers resources such as: 
   
  1.Memory management
     - Allocates memory to programs 
     - Manages virtual memory 
     - Protects agaisnt malware
  
  2.Task management
     -  Process managament: Launch Processes(process = program + state of program) and 
        Process table(list of running processes)                                                          
     -  Context switching and time-slicing 
     -  Interrupt handler   
     -  Program privilege levels 
     
  3.File management
     -  program requests to open read, write and close files 
     -  set and check permissions 
     -  buffering and prefetching handling(transfer data from main memory to temporary storage)

  5.Disk drive management 
     - Uses disk drivers which allows for the opening, reading, writing and closing of devices 
       such as printers, mice, keybaords etc.
     
*The kernel needs to be small and efficient. 

*It is  loaded into a protected area in the memory so that it isnt overwritten.
