# Operating Systems 

## What Is An Operating System:

* An operating system is a program that:

   1. Offers a user interface to start programs on the machine
 
   2. (Via the Kernel)Manages a computers components and allows the programmer to make use of resources such as the CPU,
      memory, file storage, network connections and input and outputs
 
   3. Supports systems calls
      (A system call is a way for programs to interact with the operating system.A system call is made when 
       a request is sent to the operating systems kernel.)
      (A Kernel is the first section of the operating system to load into the memory.) 
 
   4. Offers protection against threats such as malware viruses, remote hacker intrusions etc.
      (It protects itself using methods such as regular patch updates, installing antiviruses,
       and checking incoming and outgoing traffic through a firewall.) 
      
* Common types of Operating Systems include Microsoft Windows, Linux, Ubuntu Linux and macOS.

## The Kernel 

* The kernel is a one of the major subsystems in a operating system which is controlled by the user. 

* It is controlled via the shell.

* The kernel acts as the central service for all the parts of the computer and is in charge of all the 
 computers resources such as: 
   
  1. Memory management 
    - Allocates memory to programs 
    - Manages virtual memory 
    - Protects agaisnt malware
  
  2. Task management
    -  Process managament: Launch Processes(process = program + state of program) and 
       Process table(list of running processes)                                                          
    -  Context switching and time-slicing 
    -  Interrupt handler   
    -  Program privilege levels 
     
  3. File management
    -  program requests to open read, write and close files 
    -  set and check permissions 
    -  buffering and prefetching handling(transfer data from main memory to temporary storage)

  5. Disk drive management 
    - Uses disk drivers which allows for the opening, reading, writing and closing of devices 
      such as printers, mice, keybaords etc.
     
* The kernel needs to be small and efficient. 

* It is  loaded into a protected area in the memory so that it isnt overwritten. 

## Windows
 
* Created by microsoft 

* Provides a GUI(graphical user interface)meaning commands dont need to be memorised 

* Users dont have access to the source code, only memembers of selected groups do 

* Few customisation options
 
* License required 

* Has Command Line

* Interface is simple to operate

* Easily accessible online support

* Targeted regularly by developers of malware and viruses 

## Linux
 
* Users have access to the source code

* Very customisable 

* Linux is free to use 

* Linux also has command line that can be used for daily tasks and administration

* More complicated to install than Windows however is easy to operate once installed

* Many communities that can offer support to the user 

* Linux allows the user to update the OS themselves 

* Linux is more secure than Windows since threats need to be developed to 
  suit the specific build of the OS compared to Windows where most people 
  have the same version
