# Storage types

## Primary storage
  * ROM - Read Only memory keeps information if no power, used to help with startup as in it tells the CPU what to do on startup
  * RAM - Random Access Memory - located close to the cpu, fast memory, very expensive and so computers don't have much. Once a computer shuts down the data gets lost
  * Cache - Very very fast and very expensive which is why it is very close to the CPU and only very important information gets stored.
  
## Secodary storage
  * Hard drive - slower and stored further from the CPU which is why it is slower. It is also lot bigger than primary storage. Only used for safe keeping e.g, OS's
  * SSD  - slower than primary but faster than hard drives because there is no mechanical parts. It is a costlier than hard drive
  
## Tertiary storage
  * Magnetic tape - it is very old technology and is used primarly for backups due to having a very high capacity and its low cost. 

## RAID storage 
* RAID storage stands for redundant array of independant disks 
* RAID is a number of connected hard drives that are set up to in a way so as to help the speed and perfomance of a computer

### RAID techniques:
 1. spanning and software striping 
 2. mirroring 
 3. duplexing 
 4. deferred 
 5. hot swapping 
 6. hot sparing
 7. spindle sychronisation 
 
#### Types of RAID 
1. RAID 0
2. RAID 1
3. RAID 2
4. RAID 3
5. RAID 4
6. RAID 5
7. RAID 7
8. RAID 10
9. RAID 53

* RAIDs can also be combined to create types such as RAID 0/1 which would combine the mirroring of RAID 1 and the striping 
of RAID 0.
