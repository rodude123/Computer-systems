*# Storage types

## Primary storage
  * ROM - Read Only memory keeps information if no power, used to help with startup as in it tells the CPU what to do on startup
  * RAM - Random Access Memory - located close to the cpu, fast memory, very expensive and so computers don't have much. Once a computer shuts down the data gets lost
  * Cache - Very very fast and very expensive which is why it is very close to the CPU and only very important information gets stored.
  
## Secodary storage
  * Hard drive - slower and stored further from the CPU which is why it is slower. It is also lot bigger than primary storage. Only used for safe keeping e.g, OS's
  * SSD  - slower than primary but faster than hard drives because there is no mechanical parts. It is a costlier than hard drive
  
## Tertiary storage
  * Magnetic tape - it is very old technology and is used primarly for backups due to having a very high capacity and its low cost.
