# Storage types
 
## Primary storage
  * Primary storage holds the least out of all memory types and usally only holds information for a short period of time         while the PC is running.
  * Has much lower access time and faster perfomance but more costly than secondary storage 
  * Can also be refered to as internal memory, main memory, main storage, and primary memory. 

### Types of primary storage 
  * ROM - Read Only memory keeps information if no power, used to help with startup as in it tells the CPU what to do on         startup
  * RAM - Random Access Memory - located close to the cpu, fast memory, very expensive and so computers don't have much.         Once a computer shuts down the data gets lost
  * Cache - Very very fast and very expensive which is why it is very close to the CPU and only very important information       gets stored.
  * ROM is non-volatile
  * Most RAM is volatile 
  
## Secodary storage
  * Can also be refered to as external memory, secondary memory, and auxiliary storage
  * Is non-volatile
  * Holds data until its deleted or overwritten 
  * Cheaper than primary storage 

### Types of secondary storage 
  * Hard drive - slower and stored further from the CPU which is why it is slower. It is also lot bigger than primary           storage. Only used for safe keeping e.g, OS's
  * SSD  - slower than primary but faster than hard drives because there is no mechanical parts. It is a costlier than hard     drive
  
#### Why we need it 
  * Without secondary storage we wouldnt be able to save any information from the computer after is powered off, however b .     with secondary storage we are able to save files and recover the last saved version of a document 
  
## Tertiary storage

### Types of tertiary storage 
  * Magnetic tape - it is very old technology and is used primarly for backups due to having a very high capacity and its       low cost.

## RAID storage 
  * RAID storage stands for redundant array of independant disks 
  * RAID is a number of connected hard drives that are set up to in a way so as to help the speed and perfomance of a computer

### RAID techniques:
  1. Spanning and software striping (RAID 0)
     - Splitting information and writing it across multiple disk drives. 
    
  2. Mirroring 
     - Duplication of data between disks 
 
  3. Duplexing
     - Duplicates disk drive and disk controller 
    
  4. Deferred
     - Data is stored in cache but moves to the hard drive when the disk drive is avaiable 
    
  5. Hot swapping
     - Data is replaced and moved from a failed disk drive onto a new one while the system is still operational
    
  6. Hot sparing
    - a disk drive is automatically initialised into the array when another fails
    
  7. Spindle sychronisation 
      - The synchronisation of disk drives allowing the array to similtaneously write information  
 
### Types of RAID 
 1. RAID 0
 2. RAID 1
 3. RAID 2
 4. RAID 3
 5. RAID 4
 6. RAID 5
 7. RAID 7
 8. RAID 10
 9. RAID 53

 * RAIDs can also be combined to create types such as RAID 0/1 which would combine the mirroring of RAID 1 and the striping 
    of RAID 0.
