# Internet and protocols 

## Layers of the internet
 
1 - Physical layer - physical tranfer doesnt care what its transferring 

2 - Data link layer (also known as the link layer) - responsible for transmitting data across a link.

3 - Network layer - responsible for routing information through the network and allowing systems to communicate.

4 - Transport layer - responsible for transferring information between endpoints on the network and error correction, such as lost or duplicate packets.

5 - Session layer - responsible for managing a session between two applications.

6 - Presentation layer - responsible for the data formatting and display, allowing for compatibility.

7 - Application layer - responsible for user interaction. An example of an OSI application is the FTAM.

## Internet adresses

## IP 
* The fundamental protocol for how data is packetized, routed, sent, received and addressed across network devices. 
* works in conjunction with TCP or UDP
* gives devices ip adresses. 
* ipv6 stores 128 bits of data where as ipv4 only stores 32
* class a-e
* can be static or dynamic 

## TCP 
* Short for Transmission Control Protocol, TCP is a standard that dictates how to establish and maintain a connection through which two programs may exchange data.
* TCP's job is to break down messages or files into  packets that are then sent over the Internet. These packets are then received by another TCP layer that then reassembles the data into a complete file or message.
* TCP is also responsible for error-checking 
* makes ip more reliable
